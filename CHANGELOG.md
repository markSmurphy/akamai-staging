## [v2.0.0] - July 14<sup>th</sup> 2021

### New Features

This releases uses a different DNS library so that:

* The lookup of multiple domains is *much* quicker due to DNS queries now being asynchronous.
* The full `CNAME` chain can be recursed so that the Akamai domain is found no matter how deeply nested it is.
* `akamai-staging` will now return a Staging IP address for the following Akamai domains:
  * `edgekey.net`
  * `edgesuite.net`
  * `akamaiedge.net`
* Redirecting output to a file now displays any errors in the console rather than have them written to the target file.
  * This is because errors are now written to `stderr` to separate them from `stdout`.
